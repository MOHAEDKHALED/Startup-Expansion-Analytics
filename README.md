# This Startup Expansion Analytics project with power pi Dashboard 
Startup Expansion Analysis with Power BI
This project involves analyzing startup expansion data using Power BI. The provided Power BI report connects to an Excel dataset (startup-expansion.xlsx), visualizes key metrics, and provides insights into startup growth across different regions and states.

Getting Started
To use the Power BI report for analyzing startup expansion data, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Power BI Desktop: Download and install Power BI Desktop, which is available for free from Microsoft.

Excel Dataset: Place the startup-expansion.xlsx file in a location accessible to Power BI Desktop.

Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the Power BI report (startup_expansion_analysis.pbix) directly.

Open Power BI Desktop.

Open the startup_expansion_analysis.pbix file in Power BI Desktop.

Power BI will automatically connect to the Excel dataset (startup-expansion.xlsx). If not, manually import the dataset into Power BI.

Usage
Navigate through the different report pages to explore startup expansion metrics.

Interact with the visualizations (charts, graphs, maps) to gain insights into startup performance based on regions, marketing spend, revenue, and more.

Modify or extend the report as needed using Power BI Desktop.

Power BI Report Overview
The Power BI report consists of multiple pages, each focusing on different aspects of startup expansion analysis:

Overview: Provides a high-level summary of key metrics and trends.

Geographic Analysis: Visualizes startup distribution on a map using geographic data visualization tools in Power BI.

Revenue Analysis: Displays revenue distribution across states and regions.

Marketing Spend Analysis: Analyzes the relationship between marketing spend and revenue.

Startup Expansion Analysis
This project involves reading and analyzing startup expansion data from an Excel file (startup-expansion.xlsx). The code provided demonstrates how to load the data, perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualize the results using Python and various libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, folium, and geopandas.

Getting Started
To run the code and analyze the startup expansion data, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required libraries by running:

Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn folium geopandas
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code directly.

Navigate to the project directory.

Place the startup-expansion.xlsx file in the appropriate location (/kaggle/input/startupexpansion/).

Usage
Run the startup_expansion_analysis.py script to load and analyze the startup expansion data:

python startup_expansion_analysis.py
Code Overview
startup_expansion_analysis.py: Main Python script for reading, preprocessing, and analyzing startup expansion data.

Loads the data from startup-expansion.xlsx.

Performs data preprocessing tasks such as checking for missing values and removing duplicates.

Conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA) including descriptive statistics, visualization of data distributions, and geographic mapping.

Saves the modified DataFrame to startup_modified.csv for further analysis.
